#  😸 I Can Has Memes?

> Any time you try to create an Internet meme, automatic fail. That's like the worst thing you can do.

Are you brave enough to try though? 😏

**I Can Has Meme?** is an app that lets you create your very own memes! Tapping into the flurry of internet pop culture imagery, you can now (*try to*) become part of the Internet folklore too!

The app calls the [imgFlip](https://imgflip.com/api) API, which returns 100 memes ordered by how many times they were used in the last 30 days. Guaranteed fresh!

The user can then decide which image will be the canvas for the meme (or load his very own picture), type some text and drag it around to position it properly. When the deed is done, the user can generate an image file to share on all appropriate social medias 🥳 !

# ⚙️ What wizardry is this?

- [Dom To Image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dom-to-image) to convert the DOM elements into a downloadable picture 🖼️
- [React Confetti](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-confetti) for the 🎉 swag
- [React Draggable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-draggable) for the ↕️ moving around
- [React Pulse Text](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-pulse-text) For the typewriter text effect ⌨️
